    "Let's go over the controls: hold shift to sneak, use the spacebar to jump, left-click to pick up, right-click to attack.",
    "Pixel Aetherium is a game about solving puzzles. In this level, we will walk you through all of the objectives.",
    "First, visit the graveyard to the west. Examine the graves, and try jumping on the platform.",
    "If you were successful in the graveyard, some cubes will appear!",
    "Try pushing the cubes around. If you push them to their correct places, you will find a key!",
    "What could this key possibly open? Perhaps the locked door...",
    "Finally, examine the runic pillars around the altar. Try attacking them!",
    "If you are successful, a portal should open above the altar, leading to the next floor.",
    "Good luck, and happy puzzle-solving!"
